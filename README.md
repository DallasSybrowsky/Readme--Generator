# Automated README Generator

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This project is designed to generate a professional README file without having to manually create a markdown file each time one is needed. The prompts are designed to gather all pertinent information and insert it into a template. The questions have validation code that ensures no blank sections are allowed. Included are questions related to: the userâ€™s first and last name, GitHub username, email address, project title, license information, project description, commands to install any needed dependencies, test commands, and how to contribute to the repo.
